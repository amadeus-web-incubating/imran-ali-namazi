## As a Dreamer

I wish to find other dreamers to work alongside.

## As a Writer

A spirit to touch, an ember to kindle.

## As a Friend

To just listen and be.

## As a Supporter

Any cause in any way. Ideally as teams we explore new ways of working.

## As an Ideator

Lost in the act, surrendering the outcome.

## As a Celebrant

Of all things human and Divine.
