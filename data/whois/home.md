I would Imagine a world, beautiful, just, perfect. And know that GOD (the DEVAS) sees it much clearer than we. So I trust, honing my skills that one day, my writing and my inspiration will be of some use.

#### Programmer, Poet, Loving Soul

We are all a bunch of loving, lovable souls who have somehow forgotten that.

We are analogue spiritual beings, donning the cloak of ignorance for the delight of simply setting each other free.

In this pale blue dot, our planet, earth - the little kingdom, hardy forerunners are needed to tip the scales in favour of the Cosmic Divine.

Recognize the cycles… of ebbs and flows.. sadnesses and joys… heroism and muddledness, embrace the moment fully.

Break the cycle of stubborn dreams, utilize every moment to advance with vigil and virility.

Forsake your brother or Mother Nature at your peril. But know that in the END, we shall all stand together, having merged with the Source.

Be at peace blessed one… we are all children of the same universe.

Personal Wishes? To have enthusiasm and spread positivity.

Outcome? That we can all can find the gifts each problem brings and pave the way, slowly, irrefutably, towards a Life Divine.

Obstacle? The dolt-headedness in each of us and stubbornness to wait for someone to turn the light on when… if it's dark, we may BECOME the light.

Plan? For me atleast, one smile, one gesture, one crafted word or idea at a time!
