From my coding hobbyist experience, I've built a resilient offline-first approach to creating interconnected sites - the Dynamic Amadeus Web Network - DAWN.

With it, your digital footprint is lifelong, adapting to your needs and not scattered across multiple platforms where there is vendor lock-in / a need to be online / sync and security issues. No more dysfunctional ways of loading content and making changes - simplicity in a way that time cannot erode.

I offer this as an INTENT driven ecosystem for building an Internet of Missions, a curious mix of tech, ideas, services, programs and dreams. Come, let's build the impossible! The personal monuments, one brick at a time.

It makes possible a complete digital autonomy for your personal, family, education, work, social, spiritual, health, and any forward looking engagement / undertaking / project - big or small.

DAWN begins with a "declaration of intent", and its Git backbone gives a transparent record of content, as it evolves across ALL our websites.

Actual transacting happens OUTSIDE and heartfelt "Goodwill" only inside.

Interested? Request either help / service / collaboration.
